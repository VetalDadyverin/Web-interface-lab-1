    <h1>Puzzle 15</h1>
    <h4 class="text">
      The 15 puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen,
      Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles
      numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving
      one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open
      position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically,
      respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical
      order.

      Named for the number of tiles in the frame, the 15 puzzle may also be
      called a 16 puzzle, alluding to its total tile capacity. Similar names are
      used for different sized variants of the 15 puzzle, such as the 8 puzzle
      that has 8 tiles in a 3×3 frame.
